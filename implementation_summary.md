   - Solution: Added proper locks and thread-safe data structures

## Future Work

Based on our implementation, several directions for future work have been identified:

1. **3D Memory Visualization**: Add 3D visualization of memory usage over time
2. **Predictive Analysis**: Implement predictive modeling of memory growth
3. **Real-time Correlation**: Add correlation between GPU metrics and application events
4. **GPU Split Visualization**: Create visual representation of layer distribution
5. **CUDA Profiling Integration**: Add CUDA kernel-level profiling capabilities
6. **Advanced CPU-GPU Coordination**: Further enhance the resource separation with more intelligent allocation

## Conclusion

The enhancements to Memory Profiling and Chart functionality significantly improve the ability of users to analyze and optimize GPU memory usage. By providing interactive tools and actionable recommendations, these features enable more effective diagnosis of memory-related issues in machine learning workloads.

The new CPU-based resource management system ensures that VRAM is preserved for critical model inference tasks, with support systems running on CPU threads. This clear separation improves memory efficiency, application stability, and enables more accurate monitoring of GPU resources.

These improvements align perfectly with the core mission of DualGPUOptimizer to provide comprehensive tools for managing and optimizing dual GPU setups, particularly for large language model deployment scenarios.
