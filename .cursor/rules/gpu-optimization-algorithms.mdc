# gpu-optimization-algorithms

The GPU optimization system implements sophisticated algorithms for memory distribution and tensor parallel computation across multiple GPUs.

## Memory Distribution Logic
Located in `optimizer.py` and `gpu_info.py`, the system:

1. Calculates optimal memory splits for tensor parallelism based on:
- Available GPU memory ratios
- Model architecture requirements  
- KV cache overhead per layer
- Attention mechanism memory patterns
- Expert layer distribution (for MoE models)

2. Implements batch size optimization:
- Estimates per-token memory usage
- Considers model weight footprint
- Accounts for activation memory
- Handles gradient accumulation memory
- Adjusts for quantization effects

3. Layer distribution algorithm:
```python
def optimize_layer_distribution(gpus, model_config):
    memory_ratios = [g.get_available_memory() for g in gpus]
    layer_counts = distribute_layers(model_config.num_layers, memory_ratios)
    return generate_device_map(layer_counts)
```

## Tensor Parallel Split Calculator
The tensor parallel split logic calculates optimal fractions based on:
- GPU memory capacities
- Model parallel degree
- Memory buffer requirements
- Inter-GPU bandwidth
- Load balancing factors

Core split calculation:
```python
split_ratios = [
    round(gpu.memory / max_gpu_memory, 3) 
    for gpu in available_gpus
]
```

## Memory Management 
Memory optimization strategies include:
- Dynamic KV cache pruning
- Gradient checkpointing triggers
- Memory defragmentation
- Cache clearing thresholds
- OOM prevention heuristics

The system continuously monitors GPU memory pressure and applies optimization strategies based on configurable thresholds.
