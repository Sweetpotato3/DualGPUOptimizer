2. **Tensor Parallel Splits** 
- Calculates fractional memory allocation relative to highest capacity GPU
- Optimizes tensor parallelism distribution based on available GPU memory ratios
- Handles dynamic redistribution when GPU memory availability changes

3. **Layer Balancing**
- Profiles latency of model layers to identify fastest/slowest components
- Redistributes layers across GPUs based on latency profiles and VRAM availability  
- Optimizes layer placement to minimize cross-GPU communication

4. **Context Length Optimization**
- Implements heuristics for maximum safe context length calculation
- Considers model parameters, precision bits, MOE factors
- Reserves memory buffers to prevent OOM conditions

### Memory Allocation Strategy
The system employs smart allocation policies:

1. **Dynamic Memory Management**
