# data-flow-architecture

The data flow architecture centers around GPU resource optimization and monitoring with several key flows:

1. Memory Profiling Flow:
- Profiler collects real-time GPU memory metrics via NVML interface
- Data flows through configurable thresholds for leak/spike detection
- Memory patterns analyzed using sliding windows for growth trends
- Metrics published via event bus to monitoring components

2. Optimization Parameter Flow:
- Model configuration parameters flow from UI inputs to optimizer
- Optimizer calculates GPU splits and tensor distributions
- Results flow back to UI and command generation system
- Configuration changes trigger event notifications

3. Telemetry Pipeline:
- Raw GPU metrics collected via NVML polling system
- Metrics processed through middleware chain for normalization
- Processed data flows to dashboard visualizations
- Alert conditions trigger status notifications

4. Resource Management Flow: 
- Memory monitor tracks allocation patterns
- Predictive analysis drives optimization recommendations
- Resource alerts flow through recovery system
- State changes propagate via event bus

5. Configuration Distribution:
- Settings flow from UI to configuration service
- Service propagates updates through event system
- Components receive relevant configuration changes
- State changes trigger UI updates

Key Flow Components:
- Memory Profiler (dualgpuopt/memory/profiler.py)
- Event Bus (dualgpuopt/services/event_bus.py)  
- Telemetry Service (dualgpuopt/telemetry.py)
- Resource Monitor (dualgpuopt/memory/monitor.py)
- Configuration Service (dualgpuopt/services/config_service.py)

The architecture emphasizes real-time monitoring and optimization of GPU resources through event-driven data flows and configurable processing pipelines.
