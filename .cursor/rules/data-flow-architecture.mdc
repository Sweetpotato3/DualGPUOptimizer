## Core Data Flows (Importance: 95)

1. GPU Resource Information Flow
- NVML queries provide GPU details to gpu_info.py
- Parallel processing distributes GPU data collection across threads
- Data flows to optimizer.py for split calculations
- Results propagate to command generation and environment configuration

2. Optimization Parameter Flow (Importance: 90)
- Model path and context settings flow from configio.py to optimizer.py
- Optimizer generates GPU split calculations
- Split configurations feed into command generator
- Commands and environment variables flow to runner.py for execution

3. Telemetry Data Flow (Importance: 85)
- Real-time GPU metrics collected by telemetry.py using NVML
- Utilization data streams to visualization components
- Alert thresholds trigger notifications through tray.py
- Monitoring metrics persist to logging system

## Integration Points (Importance: 80)

1. GUI Data Exchange
- Theme/appearance settings flow from gui.py to persistent storage
- Model configurations propagate to optimization engine
- Real-time execution logs stream from runner.py to GUI display
- GPU utilization data feeds visualization components

2. Configuration Management
- Settings flow bidirectionally between configio.py and GUI
- Optimization parameters propagate to command generation
- Theme preferences persist across sessions
- Logging configuration distributes to all components

## Monitoring Pipeline (Importance: 75)

1. GPU Status Updates
- NVML provides raw GPU metrics
- Telemetry module processes and formats data
- Visualization components receive formatted metrics
- Alert system monitors thresholds and triggers notifications

2. Execution Feedback
- Command execution status flows from runner.py
- Real-time logs stream to GUI display
- Error conditions propagate to notification system
- Performance metrics feed into optimization engine
