Key Data Flow Components:

1. GPU Telemetry Flow
```
GPU Hardware -> NVML Interface -> Telemetry Service -> Event Bus -> UI Components
```
- Telemetry service collects metrics (utilization, memory, temperature, power) from GPUs
- Metrics flow through event bus to visualization components
- Alert thresholds trigger notifications for critical conditions
- Historical data maintained in 60-second rolling buffer

2. Model Configuration Flow
```
Model Selection -> Parameter Resolution -> GPU Split Calculation -> Command Generation
```
- Model parameters determine memory requirements and context sizes
- GPU split ratios calculated based on available resources
- Framework-specific commands generated (llama.cpp/vLLM)
- Configuration applied through launcher service

3. Memory Management Pipeline
```
Memory Monitor -> Recovery Service -> Event Bus -> UI Alerts
```
- Continuous monitoring of GPU memory usage
- Triggers recovery actions when thresholds exceeded
- Recovery strategies executed in priority order
- Results published to event bus for UI updates

4. Optimization Parameter Flow
```
Optimizer -> Layer Balance -> Command Generator -> Launch Service
```
- Optimizer determines optimal split ratios
- Layer balancer distributes model across GPUs
- Command generator creates framework-specific launch parameters
- Launch service executes optimized configuration

File Paths:
- Telemetry: `dualgpuopt/telemetry.py`
- Memory: `dualgpuopt/memory/profiler.py`
- Optimization: `dualgpuopt/optimizer.py`
- Launch: `dualgpuopt/gui/launcher.py`

The system implements a robust data flow architecture centered around GPU resource optimization, with emphasis on real-time metric collection, memory management, and dynamic parameter optimization for model deployment.
