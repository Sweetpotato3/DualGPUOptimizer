Primary Data Flow Components:

1. GPU Resource Monitoring Pipeline
- Source: dualgpuopt/telemetry.py
- Collects real-time GPU metrics (utilization, memory, temperature, power)
- Publishes metrics through event bus to visualization and optimization components
- Maintains 60-sample moving window for historical analysis
- Implementation importance: 95

2. Model Optimization Data Flow
- Source: dualgpuopt/optimizer.py, dualgpuopt/layer_balance.py
- Calculates optimal tensor splits and memory distribution across GPUs
- Generates framework-specific commands with memory allocations
- Routes configuration data to model deployment components
- Implementation importance: 90

3. Event-Driven Metrics Distribution
- Source: dualgpuopt/services/event_bus.py
- Routes GPU telemetry data to monitoring dashboards
- Distributes optimization decisions to execution components
- Handles priority-based event routing for critical GPU states
- Implementation importance: 85

4. Configuration Data Pipeline  
- Source: dualgpuopt/services/config_service.py
- Manages bidirectional flow of GPU settings and profiles
- Routes overclocking parameters to hardware interface
- Maintains state synchronization between UI and backend
- Implementation importance: 75

Key Data Flows:

1. GPU Metrics Flow:
```
Telemetry Service -> Event Bus -> Dashboard
                  -> Optimizer -> Layer Balancer
```

2. Optimization Parameters Flow:
```
Config Service -> Optimizer -> Command Generator
               -> GPU Interface -> Hardware
```

3. Model Deployment Flow:
```
Optimizer -> Layer Balancer -> Command Generator
         -> Memory Calculator -> GPU Interface
```

The architecture implements specialized data routing for GPU optimization with emphasis on real-time metric distribution and bidirectional configuration management.
