Core Data Flow Components:

1. GPU Optimization Pipeline (Importance: 95)
- Telemetry service collects real-time GPU metrics
- State service maintains current GPU configurations 
- Optimizer determines memory splits and tensor fractions
- Command service executes optimized configurations
```
telemetry -> state_service -> optimizer -> gpu_commands
```

2. Configuration Management Flow (Importance: 85)
- Config service loads GPU profiles and thresholds
- State service validates and applies configurations
- Event service broadcasts configuration changes
```
config_service -> state_service -> event_service
```

3. Performance Monitoring Pipeline (Importance: 80)
- Telemetry module captures metrics:
  - GPU/memory utilization
  - PCIe bandwidth 
  - Temperature data
  - Power consumption
- Dashboard receives 1-second sample intervals
- History tracking maintains 60-sample windows
```
telemetry -> dashboard -> history_tracking
```

4. Error Recovery Flow (Importance: 75)
- Error service categorizes GPU-specific failures
- State service triggers rollback mechanisms
- Command service executes recovery operations
```
error_service -> state_service -> gpu_commands
```

Key Data Exchange Points:

1. GPU Resource Data
- Memory capacity/usage
- Clock speeds (core/memory)
- Temperature thresholds
- Power limits
- Fan speed settings

2. Optimization Parameters
- Memory split ratios
- Tensor fractions
- Context sizes
- Framework-specific configurations

3. Monitoring Metrics
- Utilization percentages
- Bandwidth measurements
- Temperature readings
- Power consumption data
- Clock speed values

The architecture emphasizes bidirectional flow between monitoring and optimization components, with state preservation and error recovery mechanisms integrated throughout the pipeline.
