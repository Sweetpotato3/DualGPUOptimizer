### GPU Telemetry Collection (Importance: 85)
Primary telemetry system for GPU resource monitoring using NVML integration:
- Streams real-time performance metrics including GPU load, memory usage, and PCIe throughput 
- Implements concurrent processing for querying multiple GPUs simultaneously
- Collects detailed GPU information including index, name, total/free memory per device

File: `dual_gpu_optimizer/dualgpuopt/telemetry.py`

### Resource Utilization Tracking (Importance: 80)
Continuous monitoring and visualization system:
- Implements real-time GPU utilization tracking through stacked bar charts
- Configurable monitoring parameters including update intervals
- Custom threshold settings for resource alerts
- Persistent storage of monitoring configurations

File: `dual_gpu_optimizer/dualgpuopt/tray.py`

### Alert Mechanism (Importance: 75)
Intelligent notification system for resource optimization:
- Tracks GPU idle times against configurable thresholds
- Generates notifications when GPUs remain idle beyond specified duration (e.g., 5 minutes)
- Provides optimization suggestions for resource utilization
- Integrates with system tray for non-intrusive alerts

Files:
- `dual_gpu_optimizer/dualgpuopt/telemetry.py`
- `dual_gpu_optimizer/dualgpuopt/tray.py`
