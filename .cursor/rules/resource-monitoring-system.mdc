# resource-monitoring-system

### Telemetry Collection (Importance: 85)
- Continuous polling of GPU metrics via NVML interface
- Collects utilization, memory usage, and PCIe throughput data
- Packages metrics into structured Telemetry dataclass
- Maintains telemetry stream through daemon thread
- Implements configurable collection intervals

### Idle Detection System (Importance: 80)
- Monitors telemetry stream for low GPU utilization patterns
- Triggers resource release recommendations after 5 minutes of idle time
- Implements notification system for resource optimization
- Tracks multiple GPU devices simultaneously

### GPU Information Management (Importance: 75)
- Direct NVML integration for hardware-level GPU detection
- Memory usage and device name retrieval
- Fallback mock data system for testing/demo scenarios
- Real-time GPU state monitoring capabilities

### Alert Mechanism (Importance: 70)
- Threshold-based alert generation for GPU metrics
- User-configurable alert parameters
- Integration with system notification framework
- Alert priority management based on resource utilization levels
