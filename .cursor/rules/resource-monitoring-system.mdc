## GPU Telemetry Collection (telemetry.py)
Importance: 95
- Real-time GPU metrics collection pipeline tracking:
  - Memory utilization and allocation
  - PCIe bandwidth (RX/TX rates) 
  - Temperature and thermal thresholds
  - Power consumption and limits
  - Clock speeds (core/memory)
  - Fan speeds and control states
- Event-based telemetry distribution system with middleware processing
- Automatic idle GPU detection with configurable thresholds
- Hardware error detection with mock data fallback

## Metrics Dashboard (dashboard.py) 
Importance: 85
- 60-second rolling history window for GPU performance metrics
- Color-coded visualization system:
  - Primary GPU: Purple theme
  - Secondary GPU: Blue theme
  - Memory metrics: Pink accents
  - Temperature: Orange warning scale
  - Power usage: Cyan indicators
- Critical threshold monitoring:
  - Temperature warning: 80°C
  - Temperature danger: 90°C
  - Memory warning: 256MB free
  - Utilization bands: 30%/60%/90%

## GPU Information Service (gpu_info.py)
Importance: 80
- Comprehensive GPU state tracking:
  - Model and architecture details
  - Memory capacity and usage
  - Current performance states
  - Power and thermal limits
  - Driver and CUDA versions
- Multi-GPU ratio calculations for load balancing
- Hardware capability detection
- Error state monitoring and reporting

## Update Intervals
- Critical metrics: 500ms refresh
- Standard metrics: 1000ms refresh 
- Background metrics: 2000ms refresh

## Tray Integration (tray.py)
Importance: 75
- System tray monitoring widget
- Quick-access GPU metrics
- Status icon state management
- Alert notifications for threshold violations
