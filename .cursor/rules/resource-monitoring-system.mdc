# resource-monitoring-system

The resource monitoring system consists of two primary components that work together to track GPU utilization and alert users of inefficient resource usage:

## Telemetry Collection (telemetry.py)
Importance Score: 85

Core telemetry metrics captured:
- GPU utilization percentage tracking
- Memory usage monitoring
- PCIe bandwidth metrics (RX/TX throughput)
- Real-time resource utilization data collection

## Resource Efficiency Alerts (tray.py)
Importance Score: 75

Alert generation logic:
- Monitors continuous GPU utilization patterns 
- Detects underutilized GPU states (< 30% load)
- Time-based triggering (5+ minute thresholds)
- Resource optimization suggestions when inefficiencies detected

Integration points:
- Direct connection to telemetry data streams
- System tray notifications for resource alerts
- Optimization recommendation delivery

The monitoring system provides critical business value by ensuring expensive GPU resources are efficiently utilized for LLM inference operations, with proactive detection of suboptimal resource allocation.
