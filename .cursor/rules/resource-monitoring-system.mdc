Core Components:

1. GPU Telemetry System
- Multi-layer metrics collection for dual GPU monitoring:
  * Memory utilization with MB/GB auto-scaling
  * Temperature monitoring with 100째C threshold
  * Power draw tracking against TDP limits
  * Fan speed percentage
  * Core/Memory clock speeds
  * PCIe bandwidth utilization
- Importance Score: 95

2. Early Warning System
- Proactive OOM detection using memory growth patterns
- Temperature threshold alerts:
  * Warning: 80째C
  * Critical: 90째C
  * Emergency: 95째C
- Power limit monitoring with TDP percentage tracking
- Importance Score: 85

3. Resource History Management
- Rolling 60-sample history window for trend analysis
- Per-GPU metric correlation tracking:
  * Temperature impact on fan speeds
  * Load impact on power consumption
  * Memory pressure indicators
- Importance Score: 75

4. Alert Generation Pipeline
- Progressive alert system based on severity:
  * INFO: Status changes, normal operations
  * WARNING: Resource pressure or thermal concerns
  * CRITICAL: Immediate intervention required
- Automatic recovery recommendations based on alert type
- Importance Score: 80
