# resource-monitoring-system

The resource monitoring system implements specialized GPU telemetry collection and performance tracking with the following core components:

## Telemetry Collection (telemetry.py)
Importance Score: 95

- Real-time GPU metric streaming system capturing:
  - GPU utilization percentages
  - Memory usage patterns
  - PCIe bandwidth metrics (RX/TX)
- Configurable polling intervals for metric collection
- Direct NVML integration for hardware-level monitoring

## Alert System (tray.py)
Importance Score: 85

- GPU idle detection with 30% utilization threshold
- 5-minute monitoring window for underutilization warnings
- Resource optimization suggestion system
- Application lifecycle management with user notifications

## GPU Monitoring Rules
Importance Score: 80

- Alert thresholds configurable between 5-80%
- Alert duration settings between 60-900 seconds
- Historical GPU load tracking in 2-minute rolling windows
- Color-coded performance visualization system
- Support for up to 8 GPUs with distinct tracking schemes

## Memory Tracking
Importance Score: 90

- Specialized MiB/GB conversion rules for GPU memory
- Continuous memory allocation pattern analysis
- Memory utilization tracking against total VRAM
- Dynamic GPU memory override capabilities through environment variables
