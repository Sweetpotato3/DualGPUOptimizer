# resource-monitoring-system

The resource monitoring system implements specialized GPU telemetry collection and visualization with the following key components:

## GPU Metrics Collection (telemetry.py)
Importance: 95
- Collects comprehensive GPU performance metrics:
  - Memory utilization and allocation tracking
  - PCIe bandwidth monitoring (RX/TX rates) 
  - Power consumption in watts
  - Temperature readings with warning thresholds
  - Clock speeds for both graphics and memory
- Implements metric middleware pipeline for processing raw data
- Manages real-time monitoring through configurable polling intervals
- Fault tolerant collection with mock data fallback

## Dashboard Visualization (dashboard.py) 
Importance: 85
- Real-time multi-GPU monitoring panels with:
  - 60-sample rolling history window
  - Color-coded performance indicators for critical metrics
  - Independent tracking per GPU device
  - Automatic unit scaling for bandwidth/memory
- Dynamic maximum value calculations per GPU model
- Synchronized metric updates across detected GPUs

## Alert System (tray.py)
Importance: 80
- Temperature threshold monitoring with alerts at:
  - Warning level: 80°C
  - Critical level: 90°C 
- Memory utilization warnings at <256MB available
- Custom status indicators for:
  - GPU states (ok, warning, error)
  - Idle detection
  - Resource exhaustion
- Three-tier update frequency:
  - Critical metrics: 500ms
  - Standard metrics: 1000ms
  - Background metrics: 2000ms

## Metric Processing (metrics.py)
Importance: 75
- Specialized metric event system for GPU telemetry
- Unit conversion and normalization:
  - Power (mW to W)
  - Memory (KB/MB/GB)
  - Temperature scaling
  - Bandwidth calculations
- Integration with application state management
- Event-driven distribution to visualization components
