## Core Telemetry Management System

### Alerts and Thresholds
- Three-tier alert classification for GPU metrics:
  - EMERGENCY: Memory usage ≥95% or Temperature ≥90°C
  - CRITICAL: Memory usage ≥90% or Temperature ≥80°C or Power usage ≥98% 
  - WARNING: Memory usage ≥75% or Temperature ≥70°C or Power usage ≥90%
  - NORMAL: All metrics below warning thresholds

### GPU Differentiation Logic
- Profile-based monitoring for different GPU tiers:
  - High-end (GPU 0): 24GB memory, 350W power limit 
  - Mid-range (GPU 1): 12GB memory, 200W power limit
- Adaptive monitoring based on GPU capabilities

### Metric Collection
- Rolling 60-second telemetry buffer for each GPU
- Key metrics tracked:
  - GPU utilization percentage
  - Memory usage/available/total
  - Core and memory clock speeds
  - PCIe bandwidth (TX/RX)
  - Temperature and power draw
- Cross-GPU aggregation for:
  - Average utilization
  - Total memory pressure  
  - System-wide temperature trends
  - Power consumption patterns

### Error Recovery
- Exponential backoff retry mechanism
- Configurable maximum recovery attempts
- Mock data fallback on consecutive failures
- Thread-safe metric collection with recovery

### File Paths
- dualgpuopt/telemetry.py: Core telemetry system
- dualgpuopt/telemetry_history.py: Historical data management
- dualgpuopt/gpu/monitor.py: GPU monitoring implementation

Importance Score: 95 - Critical system for GPU resource monitoring and optimization
