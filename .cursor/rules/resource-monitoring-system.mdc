# resource-monitoring-system

The resource monitoring system implements specialized GPU telemetry collection and alerting with three core components:

## GPU Metrics Collection (Importance: 85)
- Collects comprehensive GPU performance metrics:
  - Utilization percentages for compute and memory
  - PCIe bandwidth monitoring (RX/TX rates)
  - Temperature and power draw metrics
  - Fan speeds and clock frequencies
- Implements 60-sample rolling window for historical trend analysis
- Custom middleware pipeline processes raw GPU metrics before distribution

## Real-time Monitoring Dashboard (Importance: 80)
- Dynamic visualization of multi-GPU metrics through event-driven architecture  
- Per-GPU displays showing:
  - Load percentage with color-coded thresholds
  - Memory usage with dynamic MB/GB formatting
  - Temperature monitoring against 100Â°C threshold
  - Power consumption scaled to 400W maximum
- Auto-detects and adapts UI for newly connected GPUs

## Idle Detection System (Importance: 75)
- Advanced GPU idle detection logic:
  - Monitors utilization across all detected GPUs
  - Triggers alerts when usage drops below 30% threshold
  - Accumulates idle time with 5-minute notification threshold
  - Implements reset logic when GPU becomes active
- System tray integration provides persistent monitoring
