# resource-monitoring-system

The GPU resource monitoring system consists of three core components:

## Telemetry Collection (dualgpuopt/telemetry.py)
- Real-time monitoring of critical GPU metrics:
  - GPU utilization percentage
  - Memory usage tracking
  - PCIe bandwidth consumption
  - Power draw measurements
  - Temperature monitoring
  - Core/Memory clock speeds
- Implements 1-second sampling rate for metrics collection
- Maintains 60-sample rolling window for trend analysis

Importance Score: 85

## Performance Dashboard (dualgpuopt/gui/dashboard.py)
- Multi-GPU visualization system with:
  - Color-coded performance graphs per GPU
  - Threshold-based progress bars for temperature/power
  - Intelligent unit scaling for PCIe bandwidth (KB/s to GB/s)
  - Separate tracking for graphics/memory clocks
- Business rules for metric visualization:
  - Temperature scale: 0-100Â°C maps to percentage 
  - Power normalization: 400W baseline
  - Clock speed maximums: 2500 MHz graphics, 12000 MHz memory

Importance Score: 75

## Idle Detection System (dualgpuopt/tray.py)
- GPU utilization monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Sustained low utilization detection algorithm
- Alert mechanism for underutilized GPU resources
- Configurable idle time threshold in minutes
- Default utilization threshold of 30%

Importance Score: 70
