# resource-monitoring-system

The resource monitoring system consists of three main components:

## GPU Telemetry Collection (Importance: 85)
- Located in `telemetry.py`
- Collects real-time GPU metrics using NVML:
  - GPU load percentage
  - Memory usage statistics
  - PCIe throughput data
- Implements continuous telemetry streaming with configurable intervals
- Provides telemetry data buffer management for real-time monitoring

## Idle Resource Detection (Importance: 75)
- Located in `tray.py`
- Monitors GPU utilization patterns
- Triggers system tray notifications when GPUs remain idle for 5+ minutes
- Suggests potential resource optimization opportunities
- Maintains watchdog functionality for continuous GPU load tracking

## GPU Information System (Importance: 90)
- Located in `gpu_info.py`
- Implements NVML-based GPU detection and information retrieval
- Provides device names and memory usage statistics
- Includes mock GPU data functionality for testing scenarios
- Logs warning messages and troubleshooting steps when GPU detection fails

The monitoring system handles:
1. Real-time GPU metric collection
2. Resource utilization tracking
3. Idle resource notifications
4. GPU detection and verification
5. Mock data generation for testing
