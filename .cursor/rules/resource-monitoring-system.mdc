GPU Resource Monitoring and Telemetry Pipeline

Core Telemetry Components:

1. GPU Metrics Collection System (telemetry.py):
- Comprehensive GPU performance monitoring:
  * Memory utilization tracking (used/free/total)
  * PCIe bandwidth monitoring (RX/TX rates)
  * Power consumption analysis
  * Temperature correlation with workload
  * Core/Memory clock speed tracking
- Priority-based event pipeline for metric processing
- Real-time monitoring with configurable polling intervals

2. Alert Management System (tray.py):
- Multi-level alert thresholds:
  * Warning: 80% utilization
  * Critical: 90% utilization
  * Emergency: 95% utilization
- Resource underutilization detection:
  * Idle threshold: <30% utilization for 5+ minutes
  * Power efficiency monitoring
  * Temperature-based throttling detection
- System tray integration for immediate alerts

3. Metrics Processing Pipeline:
- GPU-specific event transformation:
  * Raw telemetry to structured metrics
  * Automatic unit conversion (mW to W, MB to GB)
  * Correlation of related metrics (temp vs utilization)
- Historical data maintenance:
  * 60-sample rolling window
  * Trend analysis for predictive alerts
  * Performance baseline tracking

4. Resource Optimization Triggers:
- Automatic intervention points:
  * Memory pressure detection
  * Thermal throttling prevention
  * Power limit optimization
  * Clock speed adjustment recommendations
- Recovery action suggestions based on metric patterns

The system provides comprehensive GPU resource monitoring with intelligent alert mechanisms and optimization recommendations specifically designed for dual GPU configurations.

Importance Scores:
- GPU Metrics Collection: 95 (Core monitoring functionality)
- Alert Management: 85 (Critical for resource optimization)
- Metrics Processing: 80 (Essential for decision making)
- Resource Optimization: 75 (Important for system stability)
