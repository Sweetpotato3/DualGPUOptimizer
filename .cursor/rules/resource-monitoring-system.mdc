# resource-monitoring-system

The resource monitoring system implements real-time GPU telemetry collection and alert management with these key components:

## GPU Telemetry Collection
- Collects comprehensive metrics including:
  - GPU utilization percentage
  - Memory usage and allocation
  - Temperature readings
  - Power consumption
  - Clock speeds (SM and memory)
  - PCIe bandwidth (TX/RX)
  - Fan speeds

- Historical metrics maintained in 60-second rolling window tracking:
  - Per-GPU performance data
  - Aggregate statistics
  - Temperature trends 
  - Power usage patterns

## Alert System
Alert levels defined with specific thresholds:
- Memory Usage:
  - EMERGENCY: ≥95%
  - CRITICAL: ≥90% 
  - WARNING: ≥75%

- Temperature:
  - EMERGENCY: ≥90°C
  - CRITICAL: ≥80°C
  - WARNING: ≥70°C

- Power:
  - CRITICAL: ≥98%
  - WARNING: ≥90%

## Recovery System
- Progressive recovery strategy for GPU monitoring:
  - Exponential backoff between attempts
  - Configurable maximum recovery attempts 
  - Automatic fallback to mock data
  - Service continuity maintenance

## Mock Data Generation
- Realistic GPU behavior simulation:
  - High-end vs mid-range GPU characteristics
  - Correlated metrics (utilization affects temperature/power/fan)
  - Realistic measurement variance
  - Emergency state simulation

## File Paths
- `dualgpuopt/telemetry.py`
- `dualgpuopt/memory/profiler.py` 
- `dualgpuopt/gui/main_app.py`

Importance Score: 95 - Core system component providing critical resource monitoring and alerting capabilities essential for GPU optimization.
