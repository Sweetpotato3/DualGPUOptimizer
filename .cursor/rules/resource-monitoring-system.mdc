## Core Telemetry System (telemetry.py)

GPU Metrics Collection:
- Implements real-time monitoring of critical GPU metrics:
  - Memory utilization with thresholds (95%/90%/75%) 
  - Temperature tracking (90°C/80°C/70°C)
  - Power usage monitoring (98%/90%)
  - Fan speed and clock rates
- Exponential backoff recovery for NVML failures
- Mock GPU simulation with realistic metrics correlation

Historical Data Management:
- 60-second rolling metrics history
- Thread-safe metrics collection
- Filtered data access by time window and GPU ID

## Dashboard Visualization 

Real-time Metrics Display:
- GPU-specific color coding for multiple devices
- Dynamic gauge updates with configurable thresholds
- Alert indicators for temperature/memory/power warnings
- PCIe bandwidth monitoring with TX/RX rates

Monitoring Components:
- Resource utilization graphs with 100ms update interval
- Memory pressure visualization with warning levels
- Temperature tracking with color-coded status
- Power consumption relative to TDP limits

## Event Publishing System

Alert Management:
- Multi-level alerting based on configurable thresholds
- Deduplication of alerts with 3-second cooldown
- Priority-based alert queue for critical notifications
- GPU-specific alert contexts with detailed metrics

Status Monitoring:
- Real-time health status tracking
- GPU capability detection
- Driver version compatibility checks
- Resource allocation monitoring

File Paths:
- dualgpuopt/telemetry.py
- dualgpuopt/gui/dashboard.py 
- dualgpuopt/memory/monitor.py

The system provides comprehensive GPU resource monitoring with real-time visualization and alerting capabilities focused on multi-GPU environments.
