# resource-monitoring-system

GPU Telemetry Collection:
- Implements real-time GPU metrics monitoring service tracking critical hardware parameters:
  * Memory utilization
  * Temperature thresholds (90°C emergency, 80°C critical)
  * Power consumption (98% critical)
  * Core utilization
  * PCIe bandwidth
  * Fan speeds

Alert Management:
- Three-tier alert system with specific thresholds:
  * Emergency: Memory ≥95%, Temperature ≥90°C 
  * Critical: Memory ≥90%, Temperature ≥80°C, Power ≥98%
  * Warning: Memory ≥75%, Temperature ≥70°C, Power ≥90%

Fault Recovery:
- Exponential backoff system for NVML failures
- Automatic mock data generation after 3 consecutive failures
- 60-second rolling metrics history per GPU
- Self-healing through NVML reinitialization

Mock Data Generation:
- Simulates realistic GPU behavior patterns:
  * Power usage correlates with utilization (20-90% range)
  * Temperature scaling from 40°C baseline plus utilization/3
  * Memory usage follows utilization trends
  * Different characteristics for high vs mid-range GPUs

Dashboard Integration:
- Real-time visualization system for GPU metrics
- Rolling 60-sample history buffer
- Color-coded metrics for quick status assessment
- Synchronized multi-GPU performance graphs
