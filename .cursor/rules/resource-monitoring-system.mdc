# resource-monitoring-system

The GPU resource monitoring system consists of three core components:

## Telemetry Collection (Importance: 85)
`dualgpuopt/telemetry.py`
- Real-time GPU metrics collection including load, memory usage, and PCIe throughput
- Continuous telemetry stream implementation with configurable polling intervals
- Aggregation of multi-GPU performance data into unified telemetry records

## GPU Information Retrieval (Importance: 90)
`dualgpuopt/gpu_info.py`
- NVML integration for detecting and retrieving GPU device information
- Mock GPU data generation system for testing environments
- Dynamic GPU state tracking including memory allocation and device names

## Utilization Monitoring and Alerts (Importance: 80)
`dualgpuopt/tray.py`
- Idle GPU detection system monitoring load patterns across devices
- Alert mechanism for GPUs remaining below utilization thresholds
- Notification system for suggesting resource release after 5-minute idle periods

## Integration Points (Importance: 75)
- Telemetry data feeds into real-time GPU utilization charts
- Alert thresholds and durations configurable through UI
- Mock GPU mode activation through environment variables for testing scenarios
