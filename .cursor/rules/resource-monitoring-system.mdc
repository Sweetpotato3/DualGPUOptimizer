# resource-monitoring-system

The resource monitoring system implements comprehensive GPU telemetry collection and alert management:

## Core Telemetry Collection
Location: dualgpuopt/telemetry.py

Collects GPU-specific metrics:
- Memory utilization tracking with used/total memory ratios
- Power consumption monitoring against per-GPU power limits 
- Temperature tracking with configurable alert thresholds
- PCIe bandwidth monitoring (RX/TX rates)
- Fan speed correlation with thermal load
- Clock speed tracking for core/memory

## Alert Management
Location: dualgpuopt/memory/alerts.py

Multi-tier alert system:
- Memory pressure alerts at 80%, 90%, 95% thresholds
- Temperature warnings at 70°C, critical at 80°C
- Power limit approaching warnings at 90% of max TDP
- Fan speed correlation alerts for thermal issues

## Monitoring Pipeline
Location: dualgpuopt/telemetry.py

Event-based metrics distribution:
- Middleware pipeline for metrics processing
- Real-time event broadcasting via event bus
- Error recovery with exponential backoff
- Mock data generation for testing/fallback

## Resource Tracking
Location: dualgpuopt/memory/monitor.py

Memory management:
- Per-GPU memory utilization history
- Predictive memory pressure monitoring
- Token consumption tracking for LLM workloads
- Automatic memory pressure mitigation

The system provides comprehensive GPU resource monitoring with intelligent alerting and predictive capabilities, specifically designed for dual-GPU LLM inference optimization scenarios.
