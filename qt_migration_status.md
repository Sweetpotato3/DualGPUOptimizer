## Next Steps

### Short-term

1. **GPU Split Visualization**
   - Add visual representation of layer distribution
   - Create interactive GPU memory allocation diagram
   - Implement drag-and-drop layer assignment

2. **CUDA Profiling Integration**
   - Add CUDA profiling capabilities
   - Implement kernel time analysis
   - Add visual representation of CUDA operations

### Medium-term

1. **Real-time Correlation Analysis**
   - Add correlation between GPU metrics and application events
   - Implement heatmap visualization for metric correlations
   - Create anomaly detection for unusual patterns

2. **Enhanced Memory Pattern Visualization**
   - Add 3D memory usage visualization over time
   - Implement predictive memory growth modeling
   - Add memory usage comparison with baselines

### Long-term

1. **Matplotlib Integration**
   - Add detailed performance graphs
   - Implement memory usage projections
   - Create utilization heatmaps

2. **GPU Benchmark Module**
   - Add benchmark capabilities for GPU comparison
   - Implement performance metrics collection
   - Create benchmark result comparisons

3. **Chat Interface**
   - Add chat UI for testing language models
   - Implement streaming response visualization
   - Create chat session management

## Benefits of the Qt Migration

- **More Stable UI**: The application is less prone to UI errors and crashes compared to Tkinter
- **Simplified Dependencies**: Consolidated multiple UI dependencies (ttkbootstrap, ttkthemes, ttkwidgets) to a single PySide6 dependency
- **Improved Aesthetics**: Modern, professional appearance with a consistent dark theme
- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and graceful degradation
- **Enhanced User Experience**: More intuitive layout with clear visual hierarchy and feedback
- **Advanced Visualization**: Real-time charts and historical data visualization
- **System Integration**: System tray support with notifications and background operation

## Known Issues

1. NumPy version warning - does not affect core functionality but should be addressed
2. Icon path resolution might fail in some environments - needs robust fallback
3. Some UI elements need fine-tuning for high DPI screens

## Implementation Details

The Qt implementation is structured around these core files:

- `dualgpuopt/qt/main.py`: Application entry point
- `dualgpuopt/qt/app_window.py`: Main window implementation
- `dualgpuopt/qt/dashboard_tab.py`: GPU metrics visualization with real-time charts
- `dualgpuopt/qt/optimizer_tab.py`: Model optimization calculator
- `dualgpuopt/qt/memory_tab.py`: Memory profiling and analysis
- `dualgpuopt/qt/launcher_tab.py`: Model execution and process management
- `dualgpuopt/qt/settings_tab.py`: Application settings and preferences
- `dualgpuopt/qt/system_tray.py`: System tray integration with notifications
