## Recent Improvements

### NEW: Streamlined Architecture (Refactor 2024-XX)

- **Unified Backend Engine (`engine/backend.py`)**: Replaced separate command generation logic with a single `Engine` class that auto-detects model types (GGUF, AWQ, HF) and manages the appropriate backend (llama.cpp, vLLM, Transformers). Simplifies model loading and execution.
- **Signal-Based Telemetry (`services/telemetry.py`)**: Migrated core GPU metric updates (util, VRAM, temp, power) from polling to a `QObject`-based worker emitting Qt Signals. Reduces CPU usage and improves UI responsiveness.
- **Simplified Alert System (`services/alerts.py`)**: Reduced alert complexity from four tiers to two essential levels: `WARNING` and `CRITICAL`. Integrated directly with a status bar badge and system tray notifications.
- **Unified Preset Management (`services/presets.py`, `PresetDock`)**: Merged previous systems for model configurations, personas, and templates into a single JSON-based preset format managed via a dedicated dock widget (`~/.dualgpuopt/presets/`).
- **Advanced Tools Dock (`ui/advanced.py`)**: Moved diagnostic tools like the Memory Timeline into a separate, hideable dock widget accessible via the "View" menu, decluttering the main interface for core chat/monitoring tasks.
- **Removed Redundant Calculations**: Efficiency metrics (tok/GB) removed from real-time calculation to reduce overhead; planned for post-session analysis.

### NEW: Refactored Implementation Details

The refactored architecture introduces several key implementation improvements:

#### Signal-Based GPU Monitoring

- **Efficient Qt Signals**: Each GPU metric (utilization, VRAM, temperature, power) is updated via dedicated Qt signals
- **Reduced CPU Usage**: Eliminated polling loops in favor of event-driven updates
- **Improved Responsiveness**: UI components connect directly to telemetry signals for immediate updates
- **Thread Safety**: Worker thread handles GPU communication while UI thread processes signals

#### Direct UI Component Communication

- **Memory Timeline Sharing**: Memory Timeline component shared between Memory Profiler tab and Advanced Tools dock
- **Engine Integration**: Unified Engine provides model operations directly to the Launcher tab
- **Alert Propagation**: Alert Service directly updates status bar and system tray through Qt signals
- **Preset System**: Centralized preset management with access from all tabs

#### Incremental Integration

The refactored architecture is designed for incremental integration:

1. **Core Services Layer**: Backend Engine, Alert Service, and Telemetry Worker can be integrated independently
2. **UI Components**: Advanced Tools Dock and Preset system can be added without affecting core functionality
3. **Existing Features**: Gradual migration of existing components to use the refactored services
4. **Cleanup Phase**: Removal of deprecated code after successful migration

This approach ensures stability during the transition while immediately benefiting from the improved architecture.

### NEW: Thread-Safe Caching System

  - CRITICAL: Threshold exceeded (e.g., 90% memory, 80°C)
- **Composite Alert Detection**: Combines multiple metrics (memory, temperature, power) for accurate risk assessment.

The enhanced alert system provides earlier warnings of potential issues and more accurate classification of GPU conditions, helping prevent out-of-memory errors and thermal throttling.

- **Direct Settings Transfer**: Apply optimizer-generated settings directly to the launcher with a single click -> **Replaced by loading presets.**
- **Automatic Tab Switching**: Automatically switch to the launcher tab after applying settings -> **N/A with preset system.**
- **Configuration Presets**: Save and load optimized configurations for quick reuse -> **Now the primary method via PresetDock.**
- **Parameter Validation**: Smart validation ensures applied settings are compatible with the current environment
- **Comprehensive Parameters**: Automatically transfers all relevant settings including context sizes, GPU splits, and precision settings

This streamlined workflow eliminates the need for manual copy-pasting of settings between tabs or components.

### Configuration Preset System

The **new unified preset system** allows you to save and reuse optimized configurations:

- **Named Presets**: Save configurations with custom names (.json files in `~/.dualgpuopt/presets/`)
- **One-Click Loading**: Load entire configurations via the Preset Dock (double-click)
- **Persistent Storage**: Presets are saved between application sessions.
- **Combined Parameters**: Presets now store model path, prompt template, persona, and GPU settings together.
- **Easy Management**: Create, delete, and refresh presets directly from the dock toolbar.

The preset system makes it simple to switch between different model configurations without reconfiguring settings each time.

## Enhanced Dependency Management System

DualGPUOptimizer now features a robust dependency management system that:

- **Includes Fallback UI**: A minimal UI will run even when optional UI packages are unavailable

The dependency system categorizes dependencies into:

- **Required**: Application won't start without these (e.g., PySide6)
- **Core**: Application works with fallbacks if missing (e.g., pynvml, numpy)
- **Optional**: Enhanced functionality when available (e.g., torch)

## Enhanced Error Handling & Recovery System

DualGPUOptimizer now features a comprehensive error handling and recovery system:

- **Centralized Error Management**: All errors are processed through a unified handler with severity levels and categorization
- **Automatic Recovery**: The system attempts to recover from common errors like GPU communication failures
- **Smart Fallbacks**: When components fail, the application gracefully degrades to alternatives rather than crashing

This robust error handling ensures the application remains functional across different environments and hardware configurations, even when facing unpredictable issues.

## Event-Driven Architecture (Revised)

The application utilizes a hybrid communication approach:

- **Core Telemetry (GPU Metrics):** Uses direct Qt Signals (`util_updated`, `vram_updated`, etc.) emitted by `services/telemetry.py:TelemetryWorker` for optimal performance and responsiveness. UI elements connect directly to these signals.
- **Other Communication:** Continues to use the existing Event Bus (`services/event_bus.py`) for less frequent or broader messages like configuration changes, preset loading requests, or complex state updates.

This architecture balances performance for high-frequency data (telemetry) with the flexibility of an event bus for other system communication.

## Quick Start

To quickly get started with DualGPUOptimizer:

1. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install PySide6==6.5.2 pynvml psutil numpy
```

2. **Run the application**:

```bash
# With real GPU monitoring (requires NVIDIA GPUs)
python run.py

# In mock mode (no real GPUs required for testing)
python run.py --mock
```

3. **Using the interface**:
   - The **Dashboard** tab shows real-time GPU metrics
   - The **Optimizer** tab calculates memory splits for models
   - The **Launcher** tab controls model execution

For developers, you can also run directly with:

```bash
python run_qt_app.py --mock --verbose
```
