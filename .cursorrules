# main-overview

## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.

The DualGPUOptimizer is a specialized application for managing and optimizing dual GPU setups, with core business functionality organized around three main areas:

## GPU Management and Monitoring (Importance: 95)
- Probes and validates GPU configurations through NVML integration
- Collects comprehensive GPU metrics including memory, utilization, PCIe throughput, power usage
- Implements continuous telemetry streaming for real-time GPU performance monitoring
- Provides mock GPU functionality for testing and development

Key files:
- `dualgpuopt/gpu_info.py`
- `dualgpuopt/telemetry.py`

## Model Optimization Engine (Importance: 90)
- Generates optimized GPU split configurations based on available GPU memory
- Creates environment configurations for CUDA and NCCL optimizations
- Produces framework-specific command strings for llama.cpp and vLLM
- Manages model presets and configurations for common ML models

Key files:
- `dualgpuopt/optimizer.py`
- `dualgpuopt/gui/optimizer_tab.py`

## Execution Management (Importance: 85)
- Controls model execution across multiple GPUs
- Manages process lifecycle and logging for running models
- Provides real-time monitoring through an interactive dashboard
- Implements idle detection and resource optimization alerts

Key files:
- `dualgpuopt/gui/launcher.py`
- `dualgpuopt/gui/dashboard.py`
- `dualgpuopt/tray.py`

## Configuration and Theme Management (Importance: 75)
- Handles GPU-specific overclocking settings and persistence
- Manages application themes with support for multiple color schemes
- Maintains user preferences and GPU configurations across sessions

Key files:
- `dualgpuopt/gui/settings.py`
- `dualgpuopt/gui/theme.py`

The application integrates these components through a GUI interface that provides real-time monitoring, optimization controls, and model execution management, specifically designed for machine learning workloads on multi-GPU systems.

DualGPUOptimizer implements specialized optimization and monitoring for dual GPU machine learning deployments, with core business logic distributed across several key subsystems:

GPU Resource Management:
- Adaptive telemetry system tracks utilization, memory, temperature, and power metrics
- Multi-tier alert levels based on memory usage (75%, 90%, 95%), temperature (70°C, 80°C, 90°C), and power (90%, 98%)
- Smart error recovery with exponential backoff for hardware failures
- Mock GPU simulation for testing with realistic characteristics

Memory Optimization:
- Session-level memory statistics and leak detection using linear regression
- Spike detection with sliding window analysis for rapid growth (>10%)
- Memory event classification for allocations, spikes, leaks and inference boundaries
- Token processing efficiency metrics correlation with memory patterns

Model Layer Distribution:
- Layer-aware distribution across GPUs based on performance ratios
- Weighted profiling using short (64 tokens) and long (1024 tokens) sequences
- Dynamic batch size optimization with OOM recovery mechanisms
- Length-aware sequence grouping for GPU throughput optimization

Core System Integration:
- Event bus system with typed events and priority-based handler execution
