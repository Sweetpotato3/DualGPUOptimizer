## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.

The DualGPUOptimizer is a specialized application for managing and optimizing dual GPU setups, with core business functionality organized around three main areas:

## GPU Management and Monitoring (Importance: 95)
- Probes and validates GPU configurations through NVML integration
- Collects comprehensive GPU metrics including memory, utilization, PCIe throughput, power usage
- Implements continuous telemetry streaming for real-time GPU performance monitoring
- Provides mock GPU functionality for testing and development

Key files:
- `dualgpuopt/gpu_info.py`
- `dualgpuopt/telemetry.py`

## Model Optimization Engine (Importance: 90)
- Generates optimized GPU split configurations based on available GPU memory
- Creates environment configurations for CUDA and NCCL optimizations
- Produces framework-specific command strings for llama.cpp and vLLM
- Manages model presets and configurations for common ML models

Key files:

- `dualgpuopt/gui/optimizer_tab.py`

## Execution Management (Importance: 85)
- Controls model execution across multiple GPUs
- Manages process lifecycle and logging for running models
- Provides real-time monitoring through an interactive dashboard
- Implements idle detection and resource optimization alerts

Key files:
- `dualgpuopt/gui/launcher.py`
