## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.

The DualGPUOptimizer is a specialized application for managing and optimizing dual GPU setups, with core business functionality organized around three main areas:

The DualGPUOptimizer implements specialized GPU resource management and optimization for machine learning workloads across dual GPU configurations. The core business logic is organized into four main areas:

1. GPU Memory Management (Importance: 95)
Core management layer in `dualgpuopt/optimizer.py`:
- Smart memory splits between GPUs using relative VRAM capacity
- Dynamic context size calculation incorporating model architecture parameters
- Specialized memory quotas for different model types (Llama-2, Mistral, Mixtral)
- Layer balancing optimization across GPUs with performance profiling

2. Inference Optimization (Importance: 90)
Implemented in `dualgpuopt/batch/smart_batch.py`:
- Length-aware batch scheduling with memory heuristics
- Token-based batch splitting with backpressure mechanisms
- Automatic OOM recovery with cache management
- Framework-specific optimizations for llama.cpp and vLLM

3. GPU Telemetry System (Importance: 85)
Centralized in `dualgpuopt/telemetry.py`:
- Real-time GPU metrics collection including utilization, memory, temperature
- PCIe bandwidth monitoring for inter-GPU communication
- Power consumption and clock speed tracking
- Fault-tolerant monitoring with mock data fallback

4. Resource Optimization (Importance: 80)
Controlled through `dualgpuopt/services/config_service.py`:
- GPU overclocking parameter management
- Idle detection thresholds and timing
- Dynamic fan speed control with auto/manual modes
- Temperature-based throttling rules

The system integrates these components through an event-driven architecture, maintaining GPU state synchronization and providing real-time optimization of machine learning workloads across multiple GPUs. Core innovation lies in the automated balancing of transformer layers and memory allocation across heterogeneous GPU configurations.
