## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.

The DualGPUOptimizer is a specialized application for managing and optimizing dual GPU setups, with core business functionality organized around three main areas:

## GPU Management and Monitoring (Importance: 95)

## Execution Management (Importance: 85)
- Controls model execution across multiple GPUs
- Manages process lifecycle and logging for running models
- Provides real-time monitoring through an interactive dashboard
- Implements idle detection and resource optimization alerts

Key files:
- `dualgpuopt/gui/launcher.py`

The DualGPUOptimizer implements specialized GPU resource management and optimization for large language model deployment.

Core System Components:

1. GPU Telemetry System (dualgpuopt/telemetry.py)
- Real-time monitoring of GPU metrics with 60-second history retention
- Alert thresholds: Emergency (Memory ≥95%, Temp ≥90°C), Critical (Memory ≥90%, Temp ≥80°C)
- Auto-switches to mock data mode after multiple monitoring failures

2. Memory Management (dualgpuopt/memory/profiler.py)
- Session-based GPU memory tracking with lifecycle states
- Dual-threshold anomaly detection for memory spikes and leaks
- Memory timeline analysis with configurable history size
- Event classification system for memory operations

3. Model Optimization (dualgpuopt/optimizer.py)
- Calculates optimal memory splits between GPUs for model deployment
- KV cache optimization with MoE architecture support
- Layer balancing algorithms for tensor parallel configurations
- Framework-specific command generation (llama.cpp, vLLM)

4. Launch Management (dualgpuopt/gui/launcher.py)
- Framework-specific parameter optimization for model deployment
- GPU-aware process management with memory monitoring
- Automatic recovery from OOM conditions with configurable strategies

5. Resource Recovery (dualgpuopt/vram_reset.py)
- Tiered GPU memory reclamation with four methods
