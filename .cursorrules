## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.

The DualGPUOptimizer system implements specialized GPU optimization and model inference capabilities through several key business components:

## Core GPU Management (Importance: 95)

- GPU discovery and configuration management for dual GPU setups
- Intelligent memory split calculations between GPUs
- GPU telemetry collection and monitoring system
- Mock GPU mode for testing/development
- Advanced error handling for GPU-specific failures

Key files:

- `dualgpuopt/gpu_info.py`
- `dualgpuopt/telemetry.py`

## Model Optimization Engine (Importance: 90)

- Context size optimization based on GPU memory
- Layer balancing across multiple GPUs
- Dynamic tensor distribution
- Mixed precision policy management
- Smart batching with length-aware scheduling

Key files:

- `dualgpuopt/optimizer.py`
- `dualgpuopt/batch/smart_batch.py`

## Command System (Importance: 85)

- GPU-specific command generation for model execution
- Framework-specific optimizations for llama.cpp and vLLM
- Environment configuration generation
- Command history with undo capabilities

Key files:

- `dualgpuopt/commands/gpu_commands.py`

## Monitoring Dashboard (Importance: 80)

- Real-time GPU metrics visualization
- Historical utilization tracking
- Event-driven updates for GPU status
- Temperature and power monitoring

Key files:

- `dualgpuopt/gui/dashboard.py`

- GPU settings persistence
- Theme and UI state management

Key files:

- `dualgpuopt/services/state_service.py`

The system uses an event-driven architecture to coordinate between components, with specialized services handling configuration, errors, and state management. The GUI provides multiple specialized views including an optimizer tab, launcher interface, and GPU monitoring dashboard.
